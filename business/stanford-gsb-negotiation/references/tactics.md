# Negotiation Tactics by Situation

Scripts and techniques organized by when to use them.

## When They're Not Talking Enough

### Mirroring
Repeat their last 2-3 words as a question, then stay quiet.

**Example:**
- They say: "We need to think about it"
- User says: "...think about it?"
- Then wait. They'll explain more.

### Labeling
Name what they seem to be feeling.

**Format:** "It seems like..." or "It sounds like..."

**Examples:**
- "It seems like you're concerned about the timeline."
- "It sounds like this decision has a lot riding on it."

**Goal:** Get them to say "That's right" - means they feel understood.

### Silence
After making an offer or asking a question, stop talking. Let them respond first.

## When They're Being Defensive

### Calibrated Questions
Ask "What" and "How" instead of "Why" - "Why" sounds accusatory.

| Instead of | Say |
|------------|-----|
| "Why won't you go higher?" | "What would make it possible to go higher?" |
| "Why is that your policy?" | "How does that policy work?" |
| "Why can't you do that?" | "What's preventing that?" |

### Accusation Audit
List their likely objections upfront to take the sting out.

**Example:**
"You're probably thinking this is going to be expensive. You might be worried about the timeline. Let me address those..."

## When Making an Opening

### Third Story Opening
Start from a neutral perspective, not your side.

| User wants to say | Give them this instead |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| "You're being unfair" | "We seem to see this differently. Help me understand your perspective." |
| "You went behind my back" | "We seem to have different expectations about how decisions get made. I'd like to understand your thinking." |
| "You're being unreasonable" | "We're seeing this differently. Help me understand what's driving your position." |

### Stating Your Interests
Use "I" statements to express impact without blame.

| Instead of | Say |
|------------|-----|
| "You always ignore me" | "When I don't hear back, I feel uncertain about where we stand." |
| "You're being unfair" | "I'm concerned this doesn't reflect my contribution." |

## When They Anchor High/Low

### Don't Counter-Anchor
Ask questions instead of making a counter-offer.

**Scripts:**
- "How did you arrive at that number?"
- "What's the basis for that?"
- "Help me understand the reasoning."

### Redirect to Criteria
- "What market data are you using?"
- "What standards should we use to evaluate what's fair?"

---

## When They Say "Final Offer"

**Scripts:**
- "What would need to change for there to be flexibility?"
- "Help me understand what's driving that constraint."
- "If we could solve [their concern], would that create room?"

Often "final" is a tactic, not reality.

---

## When They Go Silent

**Scripts:**
- "What would help you decide?"
- "What questions do you have?"
- "What information would be useful?"

Don't fill the silence yourself. Wait.

## When They Get Emotional

### Label the Emotion
- "It seems like this is really important to you."
- "It sounds like you're frustrated."

### Offer a Break
- "This is important. Can we take a break and come back to this?"
- "I want to respond thoughtfully. Can I think about this?"

### Show You're Listening
- "I can see this matters to you. Help me understand."

## When Closing

### Summarize Agreement
"Let me make sure I understand what we've agreed to..."

### Get Specific Commitment
"So you'll send the revised offer by Friday?"

### Confirm Next Steps
"What happens next? Who does what by when?"
