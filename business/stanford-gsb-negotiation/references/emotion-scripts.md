# Difficult Conversations

Use when user is dealing with relationship strain, high emotions, or interpersonal conflict.

## The Three Conversations Framework

Every difficult conversation has three layers:

| Conversation | What it's about | Key shift |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **What Happened?** | Facts, who's right, who's to blame | Truth → Perceptions |
| **Feelings** | Emotions involved, whether to share them | Intent → Impact |
| **Identity** | What this says about me | Blame → Joint Contribution |

### Truth → Perceptions
Difficult conversations are not about facts. They're about different perceptions.

**Script for user:** "We seem to see this differently. Help me understand how you see it."

### Intent → Impact
Speak to the impact on you, not their intentions.

| Instead of | Say |
|------------|-----|
| "You meant to hurt me" | "When that happened, I felt hurt" |
| "You were trying to undermine me" | "The impact on me was that I felt undermined" |

### Blame → Joint Contribution
Take responsibility for your part without accepting all blame.

**Script:** "I think we both contributed to this. On my end, I could have [X]. I'm curious what you see."

## Diagnosing the Situation

Before strategizing, ask:
- "What happened from your perspective?"
- "How are you feeling about this?"
- "What's at stake for you personally?"
- "Do you feel disrespected or unheard?"

Then help them see the other side:
- "Before we strategize, what might they say happened?"
- "What pressures might they be under that you don't see?"
- "Is it possible they didn't intend to hurt you?"

## Opening Scripts

### Third Story Opening
Start from a neutral observer's perspective, not your side.

**User wants to say:** "You went behind my back"
**Give them:** "We seem to have different expectations about how decisions get made. I'd like to understand your thinking."

**User wants to say:** "You're being unreasonable"
**Give them:** "We're seeing this differently. Help me understand what's driving your position."

### Acknowledge Feelings Script
"I'm feeling [frustrated/concerned], and I want to understand your perspective."

### The "And" Stance
When user is stuck in either/or, help them hold both:

"You can acknowledge their intent AND your hurt: 'I know you didn't mean to upset me, and I was still hurt by what happened.'"

## De-escalation Scripts

If the other person gets angry:
- "I can see this is really important to you. Help me understand."
- "Let's take a break and come back to this in an hour."
- "I want to respond thoughtfully. Can I think about this?"

---

## When User Is Angry

Help them separate before engaging:

1. "What specifically triggered this feeling?"
2. "What do you actually need from this conversation?"
3. "Are you ready to hear their perspective, or do you need more time?"

Don't let them negotiate while angry. Help them process first.

## Advocacy and Inquiry Balance

Good conversations balance advocating your view and inquiring into theirs.

### How to Inquire
- "What leads you to that conclusion?"
- "What am I missing?"
- "What data, if we discovered it, would change your mind?"
- "Help me understand your reasoning."

### How to Advocate
Share your data and reasoning, not just conclusions:
- "Here's what I observed: [specific data]. That led me to think [conclusion]."
- "When you said X, I heard it as Y. Is that what you meant?"

Then invite them to challenge:
- "What about my view raises doubts for you?"
- "How might I be contributing to this problem?"
