# Dealing with Difficult Negotiators

## Common Manipulative Tactics

Recognize these tactics so user can respond appropriately:

| Tactic | What it looks like | How to respond |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| **You Commit First** | "Make me an offer" | "I'd like to understand your constraints first. What range works for you?" |
| **Salami** | Small concessions that add up | "Let's discuss the full package together rather than piece by piece." |
| **Split the Difference** | "Let's meet in the middle" | "What's the basis for the midpoint? Let's look at objective criteria." |
| **Idle Threats** | "Take it or leave it" | "Help me understand what's driving that constraint." (Often a bluff) |
| **Favors & Ledgers** | "After all I've done for you..." | "I appreciate that. Let's focus on what makes sense for this situation." |
| **Extortion** | "If you don't agree, our relationship is over" | "I value our relationship. That's why I want us to find something fair." |
| **Manipulation** | Using "objective" criteria that only support their position | "That's one standard. What other standards might apply here?" |
| **Good Cop/Bad Cop** | One person is tough, another is "reasonable" | Address both: "I'd like to hear both of your perspectives directly." |
| **Artificial Deadlines** | "This offer expires today" | "Why that deadline? What happens if we need more time?" |
| **Anchoring Extreme** | Starting with an outrageous position | Don't counter-anchor. Ask: "How did you arrive at that number?" |

## The Don't React Framework

When facing difficult tactics:

### Step 1: Don't React
- Take a breath
- Put things in perspective
- Don't respond emotionally

### Step 2: Diagnose
Ask yourself (to help user think through):
- **3rd Position:** What game are they playing? What tactic is this?
- **2nd Position:** What is driving them? Are they anxious? Unaware? Acting strategically?
- **1st Position:** What is driving you? Are you anxious? Emotional? How might you be contributing?

### Step 3: Choose Your Response

| Option | When to use | Script |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Quit the Game** | When deal isn't worth it | "I don't think we're going to reach agreement. Let me know if circumstances change." |
| **Change the Game** | When relationship matters | "I notice we're going back and forth. Can we step back and talk about what we're both trying to accomplish?" |
| **Name the Game** | When tactic is obvious | "It seems like you're using a take-it-or-leave-it approach. I'd prefer we problem-solve together." |
| **Just Play Your Game** | When you're confident | Continue with principled negotiation. Be firm about your approach. Don't engage with tactics. |

## Reframing Techniques

When they're stuck on positions:

| From | To | Script |
|------|----|----|
| **Positions → Interests** | "You want $X" | "What's driving that number? What would that give you?" |
| **Positions → Options** | "My way or highway" | "That's one option. What other approaches might work?" |
| **Positions → Criteria** | "This is my final offer" | "What standards are you using? Let's look at what's fair." |

## Changing the Players

Sometimes the person you're negotiating with isn't the right person:

- **Add a party:** Bring in someone with more authority or different perspective
- **Subtract a party:** Remove someone who's blocking progress
- **Replace yourself:** "Let me have my colleague follow up on this"
- **Introduce a third party:** Mediator, advisor, or mutual contact
