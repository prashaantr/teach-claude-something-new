# Framework Integration Guide

How to combine Wheeler's 7 Questions with Three Conversations when helping users.

## Decision Flow

```
User situation
    │
    ├─► High emotion/relationship strain?
    │       └─► Start with Three Conversations
    │           Then use 7 Questions for strategy
    │
    └─► Primarily transactional?
            └─► Start with 7 Questions
                Use Three Conversations if emotions arise
```

## Three Conversations → 7 Questions Bridge

When emotions are managed, transition to strategy:

| After addressing... | Move to... |
|---------------------|------------|
| "What happened" | Q3: Interests (theirs and yours) |
| Feelings | Q5: Barriers (psychological) |
| Identity | Q6: Power (face-saving needs) |

## 7 Questions → Three Conversations Bridge

When strategic analysis reveals emotional complexity:

| If 7 Questions reveals... | Use Three Conversations for... |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Unclear interests | "What happened" - explore their story |
| Relationship damage | Feelings - acknowledge before proceeding |
| Ego/face concerns | Identity - reframe stakes |

## Combined Preparation Sequence

1. **Assess emotional temperature** (Is this relationship-sensitive?)
2. **If emotional**: Start with Three Conversations framing
3. **7 Questions analysis**: Full strategic preparation
4. **Identify integration points**: Where will emotions intersect with strategy?
5. **Plan opening**: Third Story if emotional, Interest-based if transactional

## Real-Time Integration

During negotiation support:

| User says... | Framework response |
|--------------|-------------------|
| "They're being unreasonable" | Three Conversations: "What might their story be?" |
| "What should I ask for?" | 7 Questions: "Let's analyze the ZOPA" |
| "I'm really angry about this" | Three Conversations: "Let's acknowledge that before strategizing" |
| "How do I get leverage?" | 7 Questions: "Let's assess BATNAs" |
