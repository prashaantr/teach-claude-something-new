# When to Switch Approaches

## Start Here

```
User situation
    │
    ├─► High emotion / relationship strain?
    │       └─► Address emotions first (three-conversations.md)
    │           Then move to strategy (seven-questions.md)
    │
    └─► Transactional / numbers-focused?
            └─► Go straight to strategy
                If emotions surface, pause and address them
```

## Signs to Switch

### From Strategy → Emotions

Switch if user:
- Keeps saying "they're being unreasonable"
- Shows anger/frustration
- Mentions feeling disrespected
- Can't articulate what they want (blocked by emotion)

**Action:** Pause strategy. Ask "What happened from your perspective?" and "How are you feeling about this?"

### From Emotions → Strategy

Switch when user:
- Understands the other side's perspective
- Has calmed down
- Can articulate what they actually want
- Is ready to problem-solve

**Action:** "Now that we understand the situation, let's figure out your strategy. What's most important to you?"

## Quick Router

| User says... | Do this |
|--------------|---------|
| "What should I ask for?" | Research → give numbers |
| "They just said X" | Tactical response script |
| "They're being unreasonable" | Reframe their perspective first |
| "I'm so angry" | Don't strategize yet - process emotion |
| "How do I get leverage?" | BATNA analysis |
| "This is complicated" | Break it down: emotions or strategy first? |
