# Tactical Playbook

Specific responses to common negotiation moves. Guide users with these approaches.

## Anchoring Tactics

### They anchor aggressively high/low

**Don't:** React emotionally or match their extreme

**Do:**
1. Acknowledge without accepting: "I hear that's your opening position"
2. Re-anchor with data: "Based on [market data], a reasonable range is X-Y"
3. Ask them to justify: "Help me understand how you arrived at that number"

**Script for user:** "That's interesting. I've done research showing [data]. Can you walk me through your thinking?"

### You need to anchor first

**When to anchor first:** When you have strong market data and want to set the frame

**How:** Anchor ambitiously but defensibly. Always be able to justify.

**Script:** "Based on my research of [source], I'm looking for [number]. Here's what I'm basing that on..."

## "Take It or Leave It" / Ultimatums

**Don't:** Capitulate immediately or walk away in anger

**Do:**
1. Test if it's real: "Is there any flexibility at all?"
2. Explore other dimensions: "If price is fixed, can we discuss [terms/timeline/scope]?"
3. Name the tactic: "When you say take it or leave it, I want to make sure I understand - is this truly final?"

**Script:** "I want to make this work. If [X] is fixed, what flexibility is there on [Y]?"

## Emotional Escalation

**When they get angry/upset:**

1. Don't match their energy
2. Acknowledge the emotion: "I can see this is frustrating"
3. Take a break if needed: "Let's pause for 10 minutes and come back to this"
4. Return to interests: "What's most important to you here?"

**Script:** "I can tell this is important to you. Help me understand what's driving that concern."

**When you're getting emotional:**

Advise user to:
1. Buy time: "Let me think about that and get back to you"
2. Take a break
3. Focus on their BATNA to regain perspective

## Good Cop/Bad Cop

**Signs:** One person sympathetic, another hardline

**Response:**
1. Recognize the tactic
2. Insist on dealing with decision-maker
3. Anchor to objective criteria

**Script:** "I appreciate both perspectives. To move forward efficiently, can I speak directly with whoever will make the final decision?"

## The Nibble (Last-Minute Asks)

**They add requests after you thought you had a deal:**

1. Recognize it as a tactic
2. Trade, don't give: "I can do X if you can do Y"
3. Name it: "We had an agreement. Adding this changes things."

**Script:** "That wasn't part of our discussion. If we're reopening terms, I'd want to revisit [something you want too]."

## Silence/Slow-Playing

**They go silent or delay:**

1. Set deadlines: "I need a response by [date] to proceed"
2. Create urgency: "I have other options I need to respond to"
3. Call it out: "I haven't heard back - should I take that as a no?"

**Script:** "I want to keep this moving. What would help you make a decision by [date]?"

## Information Fishing

**They ask probing questions about your constraints:**

1. Redirect: "Before I answer that, help me understand [their situation]"
2. Answer vaguely: "We have some flexibility" (without specifics)
3. Ask why they're asking: "What's behind that question?"

**Don't reveal:** Your BATNA weakness, deadline pressure, desperation

## The Flinch

**They react dramatically to your offer:**

1. Don't immediately concede
2. Stay silent and let them speak
3. Ask what they expected: "What number did you have in mind?"

**Script:** [Say nothing. Wait. Then:] "Tell me more about your reaction."
