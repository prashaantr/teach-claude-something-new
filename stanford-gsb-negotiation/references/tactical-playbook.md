# Response Scripts

When user says "they just said X," give them what to say back.

## They Anchored High/Low

User: "They opened way higher/lower than expected"

Tell them to say: "That's interesting. I've done research showing [data]. Can you walk me through your thinking?"

Or: "I hear that's your opening position. Based on [market data], I was thinking more in the range of [X-Y]."

## They Said "Take It or Leave It"

User: "They said this is their final offer"

Tell them to say: "I want to make this work. If [X] is fixed, what flexibility is there on [Y]?"

Or: "Before I decide, help me understand - is there truly no flexibility, or is this a starting point?"

## They Got Angry

User: "They got really upset"

Tell them to say: "I can see this is important to you. Help me understand what's driving that concern."

Or: "Let's take a break and come back to this in an hour."

## They're Playing Good Cop/Bad Cop

User: "One person is nice, the other is hardball"

Tell them to say: "I appreciate both perspectives. To move forward, can I speak directly with whoever makes the final decision?"

## They Added Last-Minute Asks

User: "We had a deal and now they want more"

Tell them to say: "That wasn't part of our discussion. If we're reopening terms, I'd want to revisit [something you want too]."

## They Went Silent

User: "They're not responding"

Tell them to say: "I want to keep this moving. What would help you make a decision by [date]?"

Or: "I haven't heard back - should I take that as a no?"

## They're Fishing for Information

User: "They keep asking about my constraints/deadline"

Tell them to say: "Before I answer that, help me understand your situation better."

Or: "We have some flexibility" (don't give specifics)

## They Flinched at My Offer

User: "They reacted like my number was crazy"

Tell them: Stay silent. Wait. Then say: "Tell me more about your reaction. What did you have in mind?"
