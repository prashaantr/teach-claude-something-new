# Negotiation Tactics

Scripts and techniques for users to apply in their negotiation.

## Mirroring

Tell user: "When they say something, repeat their last 2-3 words as a question, then stay quiet. This gets them to explain more."

**Example to give user:**
- If they say "We need to think about it"
- You say: "...think about it?" then wait for them to continue

## Labeling

Tell user: "Name what they seem to be feeling. This builds trust."

**Format to give user:** "It seems like..." or "It sounds like..."

**Examples to give user:**
- "It seems like you're concerned about the timeline."
- "It sounds like this decision has a lot riding on it."

Goal: Get them to say "That's right" - means they feel understood.

## Calibrated Questions

Tell user: "Ask 'What' and 'How' questions instead of 'Why' - 'Why' makes people defensive."

**Examples to give user:**

| Instead of | Say |
|------------|-----|
| "Why won't you go higher?" | "What would make it possible to go higher?" |
| "Why is that your policy?" | "How does that policy work?" |
| "Why can't you do that?" | "What's preventing that?" |

## Accusation Audit

Tell user: "List their likely objections upfront to take the sting out."

**Example to give user:**
"You're probably thinking this is going to be expensive. You might be worried about the timeline. Let me address those..."

## Silence

Tell user: "After you make an offer or ask a question, stop talking. Let them respond first."
