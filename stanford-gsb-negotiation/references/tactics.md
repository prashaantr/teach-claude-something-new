# Tactical Techniques

## Mirroring

Repeat their last 1-3 words, then pause 4+ seconds. This gets them to expand.

**Example:**
- They say: "We need to think about it"
- Tell user to say: "...think about it?" then wait silently

**Example:**
- They say: "The price is too high"
- Tell user to say: "...too high?" then wait

Use calm, slow voice ("late-night FM DJ voice").

## Labeling

Name their emotion to defuse it and build rapport.

**Format:** "It seems like..." or "It sounds like..."

**Examples:**
- "It seems like you're concerned about the timeline."
- "It sounds like this decision has a lot riding on it."
- "It seems like you've been burned before."

**Goal:** Get them to say "That's right" - this means they feel understood.

## Calibrated Questions

Use "What" and "How" questions. Avoid "Why" (triggers defensiveness).

| Instead of | Say |
|------------|-----|
| "Why won't you go higher?" | "What would need to change to go higher?" |
| "Why is that your policy?" | "How does that policy work?" |
| "Why can't you do that?" | "What's preventing that?" |
| "Do you agree?" | "How does this sound to you?" |

**Power questions:**
- "What's the biggest challenge you're facing?"
- "How am I supposed to do that?" (makes them solve your problem)
- "What happens if we don't reach agreement?"

## Accusation Audit

List their fears/objections upfront to defuse them.

**Example opening:**
"You probably think I'm going to ask for something unreasonable. You might be worried this will take a lot of your time. You may even think I'm not the right fit..."

This takes the sting out before they raise objections.

## Strategic Silence

After making an offer or asking a question, stop talking. Let them fill the silence.

Silence creates pressure to respond and often reveals information.
