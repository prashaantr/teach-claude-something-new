# The Three Conversations Model

*From "Difficult Conversations" - Harvard Negotiation Project*

Every difficult conversation is actually three conversations happening simultaneously.

## The Three Conversations

### 1. The "What Happened" Conversation

**Common Traps:**
- Assuming you know what they intended
- Arguing about who's right
- Focusing on blame instead of contribution

**Better Approach:**
- Shift from **certainty to curiosity**
- Explore their story before telling yours
- Focus on **contribution** rather than blame

**Key Questions:**
- "Help me understand how you see this situation"
- "What information might I be missing?"

### 2. The Feelings Conversation

**Common Traps:**
- Pretending feelings don't exist
- Letting feelings leak out as judgments
- Exploding when emotions build up

**Better Approach:**
- **Acknowledge emotions** - yours and theirs
- Name the feelings without judgment
- Create space for feelings to be heard

**Key Phrases:**
- "I'm feeling frustrated, and I want to understand your perspective"
- "It sounds like you're feeling [concerned/disappointed]. Is that right?"

### 3. The Identity Conversation

This is the internal conversation about what this situation means for you.

**Identity Threats:**
- Am I competent?
- Am I a good person?
- Am I worthy of respect?

**Better Approach:**
- Recognize what's at stake for your identity
- Accept complexity (you can be good AND have made a mistake)
- Consider what's at stake for their identity

| Protect identity | Accept complexity |

## Key Techniques

### The "Third Story" Opening

Start with a neutral description both parties can accept:

**Instead of:** "You were wrong to send that email without consulting me"

**Try:** "We seem to have different views about how decisions should be made. I'd like to understand your thinking and share mine."

### The "And" Stance

Hold two truths simultaneously:

- "I understand you were under pressure AND I was hurt by what happened"
- "You had good intentions AND the impact was harmful"

### Reframing Blame as Contribution

**Blame:** "This is your fault"
**Contribution:** "Let's look at how we both contributed to this situation"

## When Emotions Run High

### De-escalation Strategies

1. **Pause:** "I want to respond thoughtfully. Can we take a moment?"
2. **Acknowledge:** "I can see this is really important to you"
3. **Take a break:** "Can we pick this up in an hour?"
