# Stanford GSB Negotiation Frameworks

## What Makes a Good Outcome

A good agreement:
- **Better than your BATNA** - Your best alternative if this deal fails
- **Satisfies interests** - Yours well, theirs acceptably, others' tolerably
- **No waste** - On the Pareto frontier (can't improve one side without hurting another)
- **Uses objective criteria** - External standards, not just power
- **Well-planned commitment** - Clear, realistic, implementable
- **Good two-way communication** - Both sides feel heard
- **Improves (or doesn't damage) relationship**

## BATNA (Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement)

**What it is:** What you'll do if this negotiation fails.

**Why it matters:** Your BATNA is your source of power. A strong BATNA means you can walk away.

**Questions to ask user:**
- "What will you do if this deal falls through?"
- "Do you have other options?"
- "Can you create more alternatives before negotiating?"

**Questions about their BATNA:**
- "What are their alternatives if you walk away?"
- "How much do they need this deal?"

**Key insight:** If their BATNA is weak and yours is strong, you have leverage.

## Seven Elements Framework

Use to analyze any negotiation:

| Element | Question to ask |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Interests** | What do you really need? What do they really need? |
| **Options** | What are possible agreements that could satisfy both? |
| **Alternatives** | What's your BATNA? What's theirs? |
| **Legitimacy** | What objective standards could justify outcomes? |
| **Communication** | How will you listen and share information? |
| **Relationship** | How do you want to treat each other? |
| **Commitment** | What exactly will each side do? |

## Negotiation Rules of Thumb

### On Preparation
- Develop your BATNA before negotiating
- Consider their BATNA too
- CCBD: Consider Consulting Before Deciding

### On People vs Problem
- Gentle with the people, firm on the problem
- Distinguish their worth as a person from the correctness of their views
- Speak for yourself, not for them ("I feel..." not "You always...")

### On Interests
- Clarify interests, not positions
- Ask "Why?" and "Why not?" to uncover underlying interests
- Look for interests behind their position

### On Options
- Separate inventing from deciding
- Brainstorm before evaluating
- Invent options for mutual gain
- Give them an answer, not a problem

### On Legitimacy
- Use external standards (market rates, precedent, industry norms)
- Pass the test of reciprocity (would this work if roles reversed?)
- Be open to persuasion - if you can't be persuaded, you're just bargaining

### On Communication
- Listen and show that you have heard
- Good two-way communication throughout

### On Commitment
- Commit with care, after learning all you can
- Make commitments clear and implementable

## Interests vs Positions

| Position | Interest |
|----------|----------|
| "I want $100K" | Financial security, feeling valued, market rate |
| "I need it by Friday" | Making a deadline, avoiding consequences |
| "I won't accept less" | Saving face, not appearing weak |

**How to uncover interests:**
- Ask "Why is that important to you?"
- Ask "What would that give you?"
- Ask "What are you trying to accomplish?"

## Value Creation vs Value Claiming

**Value Creation:** Finding things that are cheap for one side to give but valuable for the other to receive.

**Questions to identify value creation opportunities:**
- "What could you offer that's easy for you but valuable to them?"
- "What might they easily give that you'd really value?"
- "Are there differences in preferences, priorities, or timing?"

**Examples:**
- Flexible start date (cheap for employer, valuable for candidate)
- Extended payment terms (cheap for buyer, valuable for seller under cash pressure)
- Title change (free for company, valuable for employee's career)
