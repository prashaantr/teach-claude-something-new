# Emotional Situation Scripts

Use when user is dealing with relationship strain or high emotions.

## Diagnose First

Ask:
- "What happened from your perspective?"
- "How are you feeling about this?"
- "What's at stake for you personally?"
- "Do you feel disrespected or unheard?"

## Reframe Their Perspective

Help user see the other side:

"Before we strategize, let's consider their view. What might they say happened?"

"What pressures might they be under that you don't see?"

"Is it possible they didn't intend to [hurt/disrespect] you?"

## Give Opening Scripts

### Third Story Opening
Instead of accusation, give them a neutral start:

**User wants to say:** "You went behind my back"
**Give them:** "We seem to have different expectations about how decisions get made. I'd like to understand your thinking."

**User wants to say:** "You're being unreasonable"
**Give them:** "We're seeing this differently. Help me understand what's driving your position."

### Acknowledge Feelings Script
"Try saying: 'I'm feeling [frustrated/concerned], and I want to understand your perspective.'"

### The "And" Stance
When user is stuck in either/or:
"You can acknowledge their intent AND your hurt: 'I know you didn't mean to upset me, and I was still hurt by what happened.'"

## De-escalation Scripts

If they describe the other person getting angry:
- "Say: 'I can see this is really important to you. Help me understand.'"
- "Say: 'Let's take a break and come back to this in an hour.'"
- "Say: 'I want to respond thoughtfully. Can I think about this?'"

## When User Is Angry

Help them separate before engaging:
1. "What specifically triggered this feeling?"
2. "What do you actually need from this conversation?"
3. "Are you ready to hear their perspective, or do you need more time?"

Don't let them negotiate while angry. Help them process first.
