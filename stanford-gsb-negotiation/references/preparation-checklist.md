# Preparation Questions

Questions to ask the user when helping them prepare.

## Context Questions

Ask first:
- "What are you negotiating?"
- "Who's on the other side?"
- "When does this need to happen?"
- "What outcome would make you happy?"
- "What's the minimum you'd accept?"

## Dig Deeper

If they seem unclear on their position:
- "Why is that number/outcome important to you?"
- "What happens if you don't reach a deal?"
- "Do you have other options?"

If they seem unclear on the other side:
- "What do you think they want?"
- "What pressures might they be under?"
- "Who else influences their decision?"

## Before They Go In

Help them prepare for contingencies:
- "What if they open with an extreme number?"
- "What if they get emotional?"
- "What if they say take it or leave it?"

Ground them:
- "What's your walk-away point?"
- "What's your opening?"
- "What questions will you ask them?"
