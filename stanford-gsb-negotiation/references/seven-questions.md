# Strategic Analysis Prompts

Use these to analyze the user's situation and give them leverage insights.

## 1. BATNA Analysis

Ask user:
- "What will you do if this deal falls through?"
- "What other options do you have?"

Ask yourself:
- What's their alternative if user walks?
- Who needs this deal more?

Output: "Your leverage here is [X] because they [need/don't have alternatives]."

## 2. Decision Makers

Ask user:
- "Who actually makes the final decision?"
- "Who else influences them?"

Red flag: If user is negotiating with someone who can't decide, suggest: "Ask them: 'If we reach terms you like, can you approve this today?'"

## 3. Interests (Not Positions)

Ask user:
- "Why do you want [that number/outcome]?"
- "What problem are you trying to solve?"

Ask yourself:
- What might they really want beyond their stated position?
- What's cheap for user to give but valuable to them?

Output: "They might care more about [X] than [Y]. You could offer [X] in exchange for [Y]."

## 4. Value Creation

Look for differences in:
- Timing (now vs later)
- Risk tolerance (guaranteed vs upside)
- Valuation (cheap for one, valuable to other)

Output: "You could create value by [specific trade]."

## 5. Barriers

Watch for:
- User anchored on a number they can't justify
- Ego/face-saving concerns
- Precedent worries ("if I do this for you...")

Output: "They might be stuck on [X] because of [reason]. Try reframing as [Y]."

## 6. Power Assessment

Sources to identify:
- Alternatives (who has better BATNA?)
- Information (who knows more?)
- Time pressure (who's in a hurry?)
- Relationship (who needs whom long-term?)

Output: "Your strongest leverage is [X]. Use it by [specific action]."

## 7. Ethics Check

If user suggests something questionable:
- "How would you feel if they found out?"
- "Is this relationship one-time or ongoing?"

Guide toward sustainable tactics.
