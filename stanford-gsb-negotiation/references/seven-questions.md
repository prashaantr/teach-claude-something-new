# Wheeler's 7 Questions for Negotiation Analysis

*Based on Harvard Business School's negotiation framework*

This framework provides a systematic approach to analyzing any negotiation situation. Work through each question before entering a negotiation.

## Question 1: What are the BATNAs?

**BATNA = Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement**

Your BATNA is what you'll do if this negotiation fails. It's your walk-away power.

### Analyze Your BATNA
- What will you do if you don't reach agreement?
- How attractive is that alternative?
- Can you improve your BATNA before negotiating?
- What's the cost of no agreement?

### Analyze Their BATNA
- What will they do if no agreement is reached?
- How do their alternatives compare to dealing with you?
- Are they under pressure to reach agreement?

### Key Insight
> The party with the better BATNA has more power. If your BATNA is weak, work to strengthen it before negotiating. If theirs is weak, that's leverage for you.

## Question 2: Who are the Parties?

Understanding all stakeholders is critical.

### Direct Parties
- Who is at the table?
- Who has authority to make the final decision?
- Are you negotiating with a decision-maker or an agent?

### Indirect Parties
- Who influences the decision-maker?
- Who must approve the deal?
- Who might block or veto?
- Who will be affected by the outcome?

### Key Insight
> Often the person across the table isn't the real decision-maker. Map the full stakeholder landscape.

## Question 3: What are the Interests?

Interests are the underlying needs, desires, and concerns that motivate positions.

### Your Interests
- What do you really want? (Not just your stated position)
- Why do you want it?
- Prioritize: What's essential vs. nice-to-have?

### Their Interests
- What do they really want?
- Why might they want what they're asking for?
- What problems are they trying to solve?

### Key Insight
> Positions are what people say they want. Interests are why they want it. Focus on interests to find creative solutions.

**Example:**
- Position: "I want $100,000 salary"
- Interests: Financial security, recognition of value, career growth

## Question 4: Where is there Value?

Value creation expands the pie before dividing it.

### Sources of Value
1. **Differences in valuation**: What's cheap for you to give but valuable to them?
2. **Differences in timing**: Can you trade now vs. later?
3. **Differences in risk tolerance**: Who can better absorb uncertainty?
4. **Economies of scale**: Does combining efforts create efficiency?

### Key Insight
> Most negotiations have value left on the table. Before claiming value, work to create it.

## Question 5: What are the Barriers to Agreement?

Identify obstacles before they derail the negotiation.

### Structural Barriers
- Information asymmetry
- Principal-agent problems
- Precedent concerns

### Psychological Barriers
- Loss aversion
- Anchoring on initial positions
- Reactive devaluation
- Ego and face-saving

### Strategies to Overcome
- Reframe losses as gains
- Use objective criteria
- Give them a way to save face

## Question 6: What is the Power Balance?

### Sources of Power
1. **BATNA Power**: Better alternatives = more power
2. **Information Power**: Knowledge the other party needs
3. **Resource Power**: Control over money, time, or scarce resources
4. **Relationship Power**: Trust built over time
5. **Legitimate Power**: Authority, title, expertise

### Key Insight
> Power is perceptual. If they believe you have alternatives, you have power.

---

## Question 7: What are the Ethics?

### Ethical Boundaries
- What tactics are you unwilling to use?
- What would you be ashamed to have reported publicly?

### Common Dilemmas
1. **Disclosure**: Must you reveal information that hurts your position?
2. **Deception**: Is bluffing about your BATNA acceptable?
3. **Fairness**: Is the deal fair even if they would accept worse?

### Key Insight
> Short-term wins from questionable tactics often lead to long-term reputation damage.
