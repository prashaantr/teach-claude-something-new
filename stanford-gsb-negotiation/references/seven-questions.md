# Strategic Analysis Questions

Questions to ask the user, then give them insights.

## 1. BATNA (Backup Plan)

**BATNA = Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement**

Explain if needed: "Your BATNA is your backup plan - what happens if you walk away."

Ask:
- "What will you do if this deal falls through?"
- "What other options do you have?"
- "What do you think their alternatives are if you walk away?"
- "Who needs this deal more - you or them?"

Then tell them: "Your leverage is [X] because [they need this more / you have alternatives]."

## 2. Decision Makers

Ask:
- "Who actually makes the final decision?"
- "Who else influences them?"
- "Can the person you're talking to say yes, or do they need approval?"

If they're not talking to the decision maker, tell them: "Ask: 'If we reach terms you like, can you approve this today?'"

## 3. Interests

Ask:
- "Why do you want [that number/outcome]?"
- "What problem are you trying to solve?"
- "What do you think they really want - beyond what they're asking for?"
- "What could you offer that's easy for you but might be valuable to them?"

Then tell them: "They might care more about [X] than [Y]. Try offering [X] in exchange for [Y]."

## 4. Value Creation

Ask:
- "Is timing flexible for either of you?"
- "Who can handle more risk?"
- "What's cheap for you to give?"

Then tell them: "You could create value by [specific trade]."

## 5. Barriers

Ask:
- "What might make them say no?"
- "Are there precedent concerns - like 'if we do this for you, we have to do it for everyone'?"
- "Is there ego or face-saving involved?"

Then tell them: "They might be stuck because of [X]. Try reframing as [Y]."

## 6. Power

Ask:
- "Who has better alternatives?"
- "Who's in more of a hurry?"
- "Who has information the other needs?"
- "Is this a one-time deal or ongoing relationship?"

Then tell them: "Your strongest leverage is [X]. Use it by [specific action]."

## 7. Ethics

If they suggest something questionable, ask:
- "How would you feel if they found out?"
- "Is this relationship one-time or ongoing?"
