# Negotiation Workflow

## Trigger → Route

| User says | Do this |
|-----------|---------|
| "Help me prepare for a negotiation" | → Preparation workflow |
| "What should I ask for?" | → Research workflow |
| "They just said X" | → Give response script |
| High emotion / conflict | → Emotion workflow |

---

## Preparation Workflow

### Step 1: Ask

- "What are you negotiating?"
- "Who's the other party?"
- "What's your deadline?"
- "What would make you happy? What's your minimum?"

### Step 2: Research (WebSearch)

Search for market data. See `references/research-templates.md` for queries by type.

Output:
```
Based on my research:
- Market range: $X - $Y (median: $Z)
- Sources: [list]
```

### Step 3: Ask About Leverage

**BATNA = Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement** (backup plan if deal fails)

- "What will you do if this deal falls through?"
- "What are their alternatives if you walk?"
- "Who makes the final decision?"
- "What do you think they really care about?"
- "What could you offer that's easy for you but valuable to them?"

### Step 4: Output Strategy

```
Target: $X (ambitious but justified)
Walk-away: $Y
Opening: $Z

Say this: "[specific script]"

If they say [objection], respond: "[script]"
```

## Research Workflow

When user asks "what should I ask for?" or "what's fair?":

1. Ask: "What role/item/situation?"
2. WebSearch using `references/research-templates.md`
3. Output number + justification + sources

---

## Response Scripts

When user says "they just said X":

| They said | Tell user to say |
|-----------|------------------|
| Anchored high/low | "What range were you thinking?" |
| "Final offer" | "If [X] is fixed, what flexibility is there on [Y]?" |
| Got angry | "I can see this is important to you. Help me understand." |
| Went silent | "What would help you decide by [date]?" |

---

## Emotion Workflow

When user shows anger, frustration, or relationship strain:

### Step 1: Ask

- "What happened from your perspective?"
- "How are you feeling about this?"
- "Do you feel disrespected or unheard?"

### Step 2: Reframe

- "What might they say happened?"
- "What pressures might they be under?"

### Step 3: Output Opening Script

```
Try opening with: "We seem to have different expectations about [X].
I'd like to understand your thinking."
```

See `references/three-conversations.md` for more scripts.
