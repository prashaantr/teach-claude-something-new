# Negotiation Preparation Workflow

**Context:** User will negotiate later. This workflow prepares them with research, strategy, and scripts.

**Key concepts:**
- BATNA = Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement (their walkaway power)
- Leverage = who needs this deal more
- Value creation = finding things easy for one side but valuable to the other

## Route by User Intent

| User says | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Preparing for negotiation | Run full preparation workflow below |
| Needs market data | WebSearch → output specific numbers with sources |
| "They just said X" (mid-negotiation) | Give response script immediately |
| Frustrated/emotional | Process feelings first → then strategize |

## Preparation Workflow

### Step 1: Understand Their Situation

Ask these questions to diagnose:
- "What are you negotiating?"
- "Who's the other party?"
- "What's your deadline?"
- "What outcome would make you happy?"
- "What's the minimum you'd accept?"

### Step 2: Research Market Data

Use WebSearch to gather facts. See `references/research-templates.md` for search queries.

Give them a summary:
```
Market range: $X - $Y (median: $Z)
Sources: [with links]
```

### Step 3: Uncover Leverage

Ask about power dynamics:
- "What will you do if this deal falls through?" ← This is their BATNA. If weak, help them strengthen it.
- "What are their alternatives if you walk away?" ← If they have few options, user has power.
- "Who makes the final decision on their side?"
- "What do you think they really care about?"
- "What could you offer that's easy for you but valuable to them?" ← Value creation opportunity.

### Step 4: Give Them a Strategy

Output a concrete plan:
```
Target: $X (based on market data)
Walk-away point: $Y
Opening offer: $Z

Opening script: "[exact words to say]"

If they push back: "[response script]"
```

## Mid-Negotiation Responses

When user reports what the other side said, give them a script to use:

| They said | User should say |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Anchored high/low | "What range were you thinking?" |
| "Final offer" | "What would need to change for there to be flexibility?" |
| Got angry | "It seems like this is really important to you." |
| Went silent | "What would help you decide by [date]?" |
| Something unexpected | Mirror their last 2-3 words: "...think about it?" |

**Key techniques** (see `references/tactics.md`):
- **Mirroring**: Repeat their last few words as a question, then stay quiet
- **Labeling**: "It seems like you're concerned about..."
- **Calibrated questions**: Ask "What" and "How" instead of "Why" (Why is accusatory)

## Emotional Situations

When user is frustrated or relationship is strained:

1. Ask: "What happened?" and "How are you feeling about this?"
2. Reframe: "What might they say happened?"
3. Give neutral opening script: "We seem to see this differently. I'd like to understand your perspective."

See `references/emotion-scripts.md` for more de-escalation scripts.
