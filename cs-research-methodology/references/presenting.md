# Giving Research Talks

## Why Talks Matter

Research impact breakdown:
- Pre-PhD: 90% technical work, 10% communication
- Post-PhD: 50% technical, 50% communication

Your talk may be the ONLY exposure others have to your work.

## Goals of a Talk

### 1. Present Your Research
- Establish why the problem matters
- Justify why your solution is right
- Show evidence it works

### 2. Introduce New Thinking
- Provide takeaways applicable to others' work
- Share mental models and frameworks
- Teach something generalizable

### 3. Establish Your Brand
- Demonstrate your problem-picking approach
- Show your thinking style
- Prove you're a good researcher

## The Content Creator Model

Three components for impact:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Catch attention | Good presentation skills |
| Content | Quality research |
| Style/Brand | Your unique approach |

All three are necessary. Quality content alone isn't sufficient.

## Talk Structure

### Opening (First 30 seconds)
- **Critical**: Audience decides engagement immediately
- Grab attention with compelling hook
- State the problem and why it matters
- Don't start with "Hi, I'm X and I'll be talking about..."

### Motivation (2-3 minutes)
- Why should anyone care?
- What's the pain point?
- Who is affected?

### The Bit Flip (1-2 minutes)
- What does everyone assume?
- What do you propose instead?
- Why is this a good idea?

### Your Approach (5-10 minutes)
- How does your solution work?
- Key technical insight
- Visual diagrams over equations

### Results (3-5 minutes)
- What did you find?
- Key graphs/tables
- One clear takeaway per slide

### Implications (1-2 minutes)
- What changes if you're right?
- Future directions
- Broader impact

## Delivery Tips

### Voice and Presence
- Project so back of room hears you
- Vary pace and tone
- Pause for emphasis

### Slides
- One idea per slide
- Minimal text
- Large, readable fonts
- Meaningful visuals

### Practice
- Practice builds confidence
- Time yourself
- Practice with audience

### Handling Questions
- Repeat the question for audience
- It's okay to say "I don't know"
- Don't be defensive

## Common Mistakes

- Starting with logistics/bio instead of hook
- Too much text on slides
- Speaking to the screen, not audience
- Running over time
- Not practicing enough
- Assuming excellent work speaks for itself
