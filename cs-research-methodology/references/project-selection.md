# Picking Research Projects

## Idea Generation Strategies

### Riffing (Best for First Projects)
1. Read papers in area of interest
2. Pick one you find compelling
3. Ask: "How could I extend this to another domain?"
4. Ask: "What assumption could I overcome?"

**Why it works**: Clear inputs, outputs, and constraints. You're building on proven foundation.

### Rage-Based Research
When field assumptions provoke you:
- "This is obviously wrong because..."
- "Why does everyone ignore X?"
- Strong emotion often signals genuine insight

### New Tools Reopening Old Problems
Emerging capabilities enable previously unsolvable questions:
- New hardware (GPUs enabled deep learning)
- New data sources (internet enabled large-scale studies)
- New algorithms (transformers enabled many applications)

### Identifying North Stars
Recognize emerging critical problems:
- What will the field care about in 5 years?
- What problems are becoming tractable?
- Where is momentum building?

## Staying Current

### Daily Habits
- Paper reading (crucial for fast-moving fields)
- ArXiv subscriptions
- Twitter/social media for research community

### Regular Activities
- Attend top conferences
- Read outside your field
- Talk to researchers in adjacent areas

### Quantity > Quality
Generate many ideas. Keep an idea journal.

**Linus Pauling**: "If you want to have a good idea, you must have many ideas."

Photography class experiment: Students graded on quantity produced better quality work than those graded on quality.

## Evaluating Project Ideas

### Good Project Characteristics
- Clear bit flip (novel contribution)
- Testable thesis
- Achievable scope
- Interesting to you
- Interesting to field

### Warning Signs
- Can't articulate the bit flip
- No clear evaluation approach
- Scope too large for timeline
- Only interesting to you
- Already been done (check literature)

## Handling Rejection

### Emotional Processing
Allow yourself the Kubler-Ross stages:
1. Denial
2. Anger
3. Bargaining
4. Depression
5. Acceptance

### Categorizing Reviews

**"They don't get it"** (presentation/framing issue):
- Wrong reviewers received the paper
- Presentation obscured your idea
- Fix: Reframe, clarify, improve writing

**"They get it"** (legitimate critique):
- Hurts because they're right
- Core contribution or evaluation is flawed
- Fix: Address substantively or reconsider approach

### Plato's Cave Model

Your brilliant idea gets filtered:
```
Your idea → Paper you write → Reviewer interpretation → Their review
```

Don't take feedback literally. Invert the transformation to understand what truly needs changing.

### Response Options

1. **Reframe**: Reconsider your core contribution
2. **Strengthen**: Additional engineering or evaluation
3. **Revise and resubmit**: Rejection often leads to stronger eventual publication

Rejection can be optimal if it enables meaningful iteration.

## Avoiding Pitfalls

### Salami Science
Incremental work making minor adjustments without building theory. Avoid unless building toward larger contribution.

### What Counts as Research
Per Science & Technology Studies (STS): What counts as contribution is socially constructed by field elites.
- HCI wasn't always considered CS
- Ethics wasn't always considered CS
- Fields evolve

### Mentorship
Choosing approaches depends on context. Develop judgment through mentorship by trying different approaches around problems you're interested in.
