# CS Research Methodology

A reasoning framework for investigating problems. Core insight: every research contribution identifies an assumption everyone makes and proposes an alternative.

## The Investigation Process

### Step 1: Identify the Current Assumption

Given a problem, ask:
- How do existing solutions approach this?
- What do they all have in common?
- What do they take for granted?

The assumption is often implicit—look for patterns across approaches rather than what any single approach states.

### Step 2: Find Where the Assumption Fails

Ask:
- When does this assumption break down?
- What cases does it handle poorly?
- What has changed that might invalidate it?

Evidence that the assumption is limiting:
- Edge cases where current approaches fail
- New capabilities that weren't available when assumption was made
- Adjacent fields that solve similar problems differently

### Step 3: Propose the Alternative

Articulate clearly:
- "Current approaches assume X. Instead, consider Y."
- The alternative must be specific and testable
- Explain WHY the alternative addresses the limitation

### Step 4: Identify Evidence Needed

What would prove the alternative works?
- What comparison would be convincing?
- What would demonstrate improvement?
- What would show this isn't just different but better?
