# Writing a Research Paper

## The Paper's Purpose

A paper is a communication device that presents:
1. Why the problem matters
2. Why your approach is right
3. Evidence that it works
4. What changes if you're right

## The 6-Paragraph Introduction

This structure makes your case before readers see details:

### Paragraph 1: Problem Motivation
- Why does this problem matter?
- Cite prior work establishing importance
- Create urgency

### Paragraph 2: Set Up the Bit
- What's the limiting assumption in all prior work?
- "Why isn't this solved yet?"
- This is the status quo you're challenging

### Paragraph 3: Flip the Bit (Your Thesis)
- State your high-level conceptual solution
- "We propose X instead"
- Explain why it's a good idea for this problem

### Paragraph 4: Instantiate the Bit
- Map abstract idea to concrete system/algorithm
- Name your system
- Show how architecture embodies the flip

### Paragraph 5: Evaluation
- How you prove the flip works
- What you measured and found
- Key quantitative results

### Paragraph 6: Broader Implications
- What changes if your approach succeeds?
- Avoid overstating
- Connect to larger research agenda

## Paper Sections

### Abstract
- Self-contained summary
- Reader should understand contribution from abstract alone
- ~150-250 words

### Introduction
- The 6 paragraphs above
- Reviewers often decide accept/reject here

### Related Work
- Build argument, don't just list papers
- Each paragraph has a thesis about prior work
- Conclude each section with your differentiation

### Methods/System
- Technical details of your approach
- Enough detail to reproduce
- Connect back to your bit flip

### Evaluation
- Experimental setup
- Results with visualizations
- Analysis and interpretation

### Discussion
- Limitations
- Future work
- Broader impact

### Conclusion
- Restate contribution
- Key takeaways

## Paper Genres

| Genre | Risk Level | Strategy |
|-------|------------|----------|
| Old problem / New solution | Lowest | Leverage existing problem warrant |
| New problem / Old solution | Medium | Must establish problem importance |
| New problem / New solution | Highest | Readers may reject either innovation |

**Recommendation**: Flip one bit. Don't argue new problem AND new solution simultaneously.

## Writing Process

### Start with Outline
- Six sentences (one per intro paragraph)
- Should fully convey your idea
- If outline is unclear, idea is unclear

### Keep It Taut
- Each paragraph proves its topic sentence
- Remove interesting but irrelevant points
- Every sentence earns its place

### Be Precise
- Assume reviewers scrutinize every sentence
- Avoid overstatement
- Back strong claims with citations

### Visual Communication
- Figures and tables convey complex ideas
- One clear takeaway per figure
- Label all axes with units

### Iterate
- First drafts are never publication-ready
- Update intro/related work as understanding evolves
- Multiple revision cycles expected

## Common Mistakes

- Focusing only on technical details (missing the "why")
- Overstatement without evidence
- Burying the contribution
- Concept vs. implementation confusion
- Writing for yourself instead of readers
