# Literature Review

## Purpose

Find your unique axis of novelty by understanding the design space of prior work.

## The Three-Step Search Process

### Step 1: Start with Nearest Neighbor
Find the paper closest to your idea in design space:
- What's its main point (bit flip)?
- What evidence supports it?
- What are its design axes?

### Step 2: Expand Horizon (3-5 rounds)

**Backward influence** (who influenced this paper):
- Check citations in Introduction and Related Work

**Forward influence** (who was influenced by this paper):
- Google Scholar "Cited By"
- Semantic Scholar connections

**Relatedness**:
- Related articles features
- ArXiv recommendation graphs
- Tools: elicit.org, researchrabbit.ai

### Step 3: Filter by Quality
Prioritize:
- Reputable venues (top conferences/journals)
- High citation counts (relative to age)
- Avoid institutional bias (don't ignore industry or non-US research)

## Reading Strategy

**Don't aim for complete understanding of every sentence.**

For each paper, extract:
1. Main point (the bit flip)
2. Supporting evidence
3. Design axes (how it differs from others)

Goal: Understand the landscape, not every paper deeply.

## Design Space Mapping

Create a visual map:
- X and Y axes = key dimensions where papers vary
- Plot each paper as a point
- Identify gaps = potential opportunities

Example axes:
- Supervised ↔ Unsupervised
- Single-task ↔ Multi-task
- Domain-specific ↔ General-purpose

## Affinity Mapping for Related Work

1. One sticky note per paper
2. Group by similar thesis (not just topic)
3. Each group becomes a paragraph
4. Topic sentence = shared thesis of that group
5. Support with citations
6. Conclude with your flip

## Writing Related Work

**Structure each paragraph:**
```
[Topic sentence stating the thesis]
[Paper A shows this because...]
[Paper B demonstrates...]
[However, our work differs by...]
```

**Avoid**: Just listing papers without building an argument.

## Stopping Criteria

Track learning per paper. Learning asymptotes predictably:
- Papers 1-5: Most learning happens here
- Papers 10-15: Diminishing returns
- Target: ~15 papers for course project, 25-35 for PhD
