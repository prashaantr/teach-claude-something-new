# Research Methods

Systematic framework for investigating problems based on Stanford CS197.

## Core Concept: The Bit Flip

All research follows this pattern:
1. **Identify the bit**: What does everyone assume?
2. **Flip it**: Propose an alternative
3. **Prove it**: Demonstrate it works better

See [references/bit-flip.md](references/bit-flip.md) for detailed framework.

## Investigation Workflow

### Phase 1: Frame the Problem
- Articulate current assumptions
- Identify the limiting assumption to challenge
- Propose alternative framing

### Phase 2: Map the Landscape
Review prior work to find your unique position.
See [references/literature-review.md](references/literature-review.md).

### Phase 3: Vector
Identify the biggest uncertainty and focus there.
See [references/vectoring.md](references/vectoring.md).

### Phase 4: Execute with Velocity
Reduce risk rapidly by distinguishing core from periphery.
See [references/velocity.md](references/velocity.md).

### Phase 5: Validate
Design evaluation matching your claim type.
See [references/evaluation.md](references/evaluation.md).
