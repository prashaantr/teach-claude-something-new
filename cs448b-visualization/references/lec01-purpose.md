# Lecture 01: The Purpose of Visualization

## Core Definitions
- **Visualization**: "Transformation of symbolic into geometric" (McCormick 1987); "Finding artificial memory that best supports natural perception" (Bertin 1967); "Computer-generated, interactive, visual representations to amplify cognition" (Card, Mackinlay, Shneiderman 1999)

## Three Purposes of Visualization

### 1. Record
- Capture information: photographs, blueprints, drawings
- Examples: Muybridge horse motion photos (1884), Galileo moon drawings (1616)

### 2. Support Reasoning (Analyze)
- Process/calculate, reason about data, expand memory
- **Challenger disaster**: Poor visualization of O-ring temperature data; Tufte's redesign showed clear low-temp correlation with damage
- **John Snow cholera map** (1854): Plotted cases on map, identified Broad St. pump as source
- **Anscombe's Quartet**: 4 datasets with identical statistics (mean, std dev, regression) but vastly different visual patterns - demonstrates why visualization matters
- **External memory**: Paper & pencil multiplication ~4x faster than mental (reduces cognitive load)

### 3. Communicate, Inform, Inspire (Present)
- Share, persuade, emphasize important data aspects
- **Nightingale** (1858): Mortality diagram - "affect through eyes what we fail to convey through word-proof ears"
- **W.E.B. Du Bois**: Data portraits visualizing Black America (1900 Paris Exposition)
- **Franklin's X-ray crystallography** (1952): Led to Watson & Crick's DNA double helix model

## Why Visualize?
- Answer/discover questions
- Make decisions
- See data in context
- Expand memory
- Support graphical calculation
- Find patterns
- Present arguments
- Tell stories
- Inspire

## Key Quotes
- **Herb Simon**: "Information consumes attention... wealth of information creates poverty of attention"
- **Hal Varian**: "Ability to understand, process, extract value, visualize, communicate data... hugely important skill"

## Visualization Research Goals
1. Understand how visualizations convey information (perception, mental models)
2. Develop principles/techniques for effective visualizations (leverage perception/cognition)
