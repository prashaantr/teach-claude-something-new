# Pneumonia Signs on Chest X-Ray

Detailed descriptions of the 6 key radiographic signs of pneumonia.

## 1. Consolidation

**Definition:** Homogeneous opacification where alveolar air is replaced by pus, fluid, or cells.

**Key characteristics:**
- Spreads via pores of Kohn and canals of Lambert between alveoli
- Stops sharply at fissures (sharp fissural borders, ill-defined elsewhere)
- **NO significant volume loss** — this distinguishes from atelectasis

**Patterns:**
- Lobar: Entire lobe/segment, classic S. pneumoniae
- Bronchopneumonia: Patchy, multifocal, peribronchial
- Round: Spherical opacity (almost exclusively pediatric <12y)

## 2. Air Bronchograms

**Definition:** Visualization of air-filled bronchi as dark branching structures within surrounding opacified lung.

**Why it matters:**
- Confirms opacity is parenchymal (not pleural)
- Strongly indicates consolidation
- **Notably RARE in cardiogenic pulmonary edema** — key discriminator
- First described by Fleischner (1948)

**When visible:** Only when alveolar fluid (pus, edema, blood) surrounds the airways.

## 3. Silhouette Sign

**Definition:** Loss of a normal lung-soft tissue interface when pathology replaces air in adjacent lung.

**Localization map:**

| Border Lost | Pathology Location |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Right heart border | Right middle lobe |
| Left heart border | Lingula |
| Right hemidiaphragm | Right lower lobe (anterior basal) |
| Left hemidiaphragm | Left lower lobe |
| Aortic knob | Left upper lobe |
| Descending aorta | Left lower lobe (posterior) |

**Mechanism:** Structures in the same plane lose their interface when both have similar density.

## 4. Ground-Glass Opacity (GGO)

**Definition:** Hazy increased density that does NOT obscure underlying vascular structures.

**Associated conditions:**
- Viral pneumonia
- COVID-19 (bilateral, peripheral, lower lobe predominant)
- PCP (Pneumocystis) — bilateral, perihilar
- Early bacterial infection
- ARDS

**Key distinction from consolidation:** Vessels visible through GGO; obscured by consolidation.

## 5. Interstitial Pattern

**Definition:** Reticular (net-like) or reticulonodular markings without airspace filling.

**Suggests:**
- Atypical organisms: Mycoplasma, Chlamydia
- Viral pneumonia
- Only 3.5% of bacterial pneumonias present this way

**Appearance:** Fine linear or nodular markings, often diffuse.

## 6. Pleural Effusion

**Definition:** Fluid in the pleural space, appearing as blunted costophrenic angle.

**Pneumonia association:**
- Present in 20-57% of bacterial pneumonias
- Parapneumonic effusion may become empyema
- May be the only sign in early/atypical presentations

**Other causes to consider:** Heart failure, malignancy, TB

## Associated Findings

**Cavitation:** Suggests:
- Staphylococcus aureus
- Klebsiella pneumoniae
- Anaerobes
- Tuberculosis

**Bulging fissure:** Classic for Klebsiella (voluminous exudate expanding lobe).

**Pneumatoceles:** Air-filled cysts, classic for Staph aureus.

## Pneumonia Subtypes by Pattern

| Pattern | Appearance | Typical Organisms |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| Lobar | Homogeneous, entire lobe, air bronchograms | S. pneumoniae (40% CAP), Klebsiella |
| Bronchopneumonia | Patchy, multifocal, bilateral, peribronchial | Staph aureus, gram-negatives |
| Interstitial | Reticular/reticulonodular, no consolidation | Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, viruses |
| Round | Well-circumscribed sphere (kids <12y) | S. pneumoniae (90%) |

## Atypical Patterns

**COVID-19:**
- Bilateral peripheral/subpleural GGO
- Lower lobe predominant
- NO pleural effusion or lymphadenopathy (distinguishing features)

**PCP (immunocompromised):**
- Bilateral diffuse perihilar GGO
- "Bat wing" distribution

**TB reactivation:**
- Upper lobe predominant
- Cavitation
- Tree-in-bud nodules
