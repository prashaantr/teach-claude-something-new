# Complete Radiologist CXR Workflow

Detailed breakdown of the systematic chest X-ray interpretation process.

## Pre-Interpretation: RIPE Quality Assessment

Before any diagnostic reasoning, assess technical quality.

### R - Rotation

**Check:** Are the medial ends of the clavicles equidistant from the spinous processes?

**Impact of rotation:**
- Creates false densities
- Asymmetric appearance of normal structures
- May simulate or mask pathology
- Heart may appear larger on one side

### I - Inspiration

**Check:** Count ribs visible above the diaphragm.

| View | Adequate Inspiration |
|------|---------------------|
| PA | 5-6 anterior ribs OR 8-10 posterior ribs |
| AP | May show fewer ribs (supine positioning) |

**Impact of poor inspiration:**
- Basilar crowding mimics pneumonia/edema
- Apparent cardiomegaly
- Increased pulmonary vascular markings
- May hide or create false opacities

### P - Penetration

**Check:** Can you see the vertebral bodies through the cardiac shadow?

| Quality | Appearance |
|---------|------------|
| Adequate | Vertebrae JUST visible behind heart |
| Underpenetrated | Vertebrae not visible, image too white |
| Overpenetrated | Too dark, loss of bone detail |

**Impact of underpenetration:**
- Hides retrocardiac pathology (the #1 missed location)
- May miss left lower lobe pneumonia
- Creates false densities

### E - Exposure (Projection Type)

**PA (Posteroanterior):**
- Standard technique, patient facing film
- Heart size accurate
- CTR <50% is normal

**AP (Anteroposterior):**
- Portable/bedside technique
- **Heart appears ~20% larger** (magnified)
- CTR cutoff less reliable
- Often supine, which affects fluid distribution

**Always note projection type** — affects heart size interpretation.

## Systematic Interpretation: ABCDE

Complete each section before moving to the next. Document findings, not diagnoses.

### A - Airway

**Trachea:**
- Should be midline (or slightly right at carina level)
- Deviation suggests mass, collapse, or tension pneumothorax
- Check for narrowing or compression

**Carina:**
- Should be at T4-T5 level
- Angle normally <90° between main bronchi
- Widening suggests subcarinal mass

**Main bronchi:**
- Right is wider, more vertical (aspiration goes here)
- Check for cutoff or narrowing

**Hila:**
- Left hilum normally 1-3cm higher than right
- Check density, shape, position
- Mass, lymphadenopathy may alter appearance

### B - Breathing (Lungs) + Bones

**Lung fields - divide into zones:**

| Zone | Boundaries |
|------|------------|
| Upper | Apex to 2nd anterior rib |
| Middle | 2nd to 4th anterior rib |
| Lower | 4th rib to diaphragm |

**For each zone, assess:**
- Lung markings (should taper toward periphery)
- Abnormal opacities
- Lucencies (may indicate pneumothorax or bullae)

**Pleural spaces:**
- Costophrenic angles (should be sharp)
- Apices
- Fissures (horizontal fissure visible on PA in ~60%)

**Bones:**
- Ribs: fractures, lytic lesions, notching
- Clavicles: fractures, erosions
- Spine: alignment, vertebral body height
- Shoulders (if visible): humeral head, AC joint

### C - Cardiac

**Heart size:**
- Cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) = heart width / thorax width
- Normal: <50% on PA
- AP films: use caution, magnification effect

**Heart borders:**
- Right: right atrium
- Left: left ventricle (and left atrial appendage)
- Loss of border = silhouette sign → adjacent pathology

**Mediastinum:**
- Aortic knob
- Superior mediastinum width
- Paratracheal stripe

### D - Diaphragm

**Position:**
- Right usually 1-2cm higher than left (liver)
- Flat diaphragm suggests hyperinflation (COPD)
- Elevated hemidiaphragm: phrenic nerve palsy, atelectasis

**Costophrenic angles:**
- Should be sharp
- Blunting suggests effusion (>200mL needed to blunt on upright)

**Subdiaphragmatic:**
- Free air under diaphragm = perforation (upright film needed)
- Gastric bubble on left

### E - Everything Else

**Soft tissues:**
- Subcutaneous emphysema
- Breast shadows (asymmetry may be mastectomy)
- Chest wall masses

**Lines and tubes:**
- ETT tip: 2-6cm above carina
- Central lines: tip in SVC
- NG tube: below diaphragm
- Chest tubes: in pleural space

**Review areas (blind spots):**
- See dedicated section below

---

## Blind Spots: Mandatory Review Areas

These locations have the highest miss rates. Check EVERY case.

### 1. Retrocardiac Region (Left Lower Lobe)

**Why missed:** Obscured by cardiac shadow on frontal view.

**How to see:**
- "Window" the image (adjust brightness/contrast)
- Look for "spine sign" on lateral (vertebrae should get MORE lucent going down; interruption = pathology)
- PA view: look for loss of left hemidiaphragm silhouette

**Miss rate:** #1 location for missed pneumonia.

### 2. Lung Apices

**Why missed:** Overlapping clavicles and first ribs create complex shadows.

**What hides here:**
- Pancoast tumors
- Tuberculosis (apical predilection)
- Small pneumothoraces

**How to see:** Deliberately inspect above clavicles and trace first rib.

### 3. Infra-diaphragmatic Lung

**Why missed:** Posterior basal segments project below diaphragm dome.

**How to see:**
- Look through diaphragm for opacities
- Compare density below right vs left diaphragm
- Lateral view shows posterior costophrenic angle

### 4. Hilar Regions

**Why missed:** Normal vascular structures create complex appearance.

**What hides here:**
- Central masses
- Lymphadenopathy
- Pulmonary artery pathology

**How to see:**
- Compare bilateral hilar size and density
- Look for convexity where concavity expected
- 13.5% of missed lesions are hilar

### 5. Behind Clavicles

**Why missed:** Bone density masks underlying lung.

**How to see:**
- Trace entire clavicle, looking deep to bone
- Compare symmetry
- Adjust window/level if digital

## Error Prevention

### Satisfaction of Search

**Problem:** Finding one abnormality and stopping the search.

**Solution:** ALWAYS complete the entire ABCDE + blind spots, regardless of findings.

### Perceptual Error

**Problem:** Failing to see a visible finding.

**Solution:**
- Systematic approach (never skip sections)
- Adequate viewing conditions
- Review prior images for comparison

### Cognitive Error

**Problem:** Seeing finding but misinterpreting.

**Solution:**
- Apply differential diagnosis framework
- Consider clinical context
- Use confidence calibration

## Time Management

Eye-tracking studies show experienced radiologists use a dual-phase approach:

1. **Gestalt phase (first 300ms):** Rapid holistic pattern recognition catches most major abnormalities
2. **Systematic phase:** Deliberate checklist-based review confirms and catches additional findings

Both phases are essential. The gestalt catches obvious pathology; the systematic review catches subtle findings and prevents satisfaction of search error.
