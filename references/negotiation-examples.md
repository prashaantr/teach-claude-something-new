### Situation
Family negotiating with hospital about treatment for elderly grandfather.

- Key: Both perspectives valid

**Feelings**
- Family: Fear, grief, guilt
- Medical team: Responsibility, desire to help

**Identity**
- Family: "Are we good children if we don't fight for every treatment?"
- Reframe: "honoring his wishes" vs "giving up"

## Example 3: Vendor Contract

### Situation
Renewing software subscription. Vendor proposed 15% price increase.

### Preparation

**Research**
- Found 2 competitor alternatives
- Usage data: Team used only 60% of features
- Similar company contracts for comparison

**Strategic Analysis**
- Company BATNA: Switch (high switching cost)
- Vendor BATNA: Lose account (significant revenue)

**Value Creation**
- Offered 2-year commitment
- Asked about removing unused features
- Proposed case study participation

### Outcome
- 5% increase instead of 15%
- Removed unused modules (-10%)
- 2-year price protection
- Net: Lower than current contract

### Lessons
- Research alternatives even if not planning to switch
- Pay only for what you use
- Multi-year commitments are currency

## Example 4: Home Purchase

### Situation
First-time buyers. Asking price $550,000. Budget constraints.

### Research Found
- Comparable sales: $510,000-$560,000
- Days on market: 45 (above average)
- Recent price reduction from $575,000
- Seller motivation: Job relocation

### Strategy
**Opening:** $505,000 with personal letter

**Counteroffer received:** $540,000

**Response:** $520,000 + quick inspection + flexible closing

**Final:** $525,000 with appliances included

### Lessons
- Days on market and seller motivation = power
- Personal connection matters
- Non-price terms create value
