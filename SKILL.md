# Negotiation Skill

## Overview

This skill enables you to serve as a negotiation coach and preparation partner. You help users analyze their negotiation situations, prepare strategically, and develop proposals grounded in research and proven frameworks.

## When This Skill Activates

Use this skill when the user:
- Is preparing for a negotiation (salary, contract, purchase, dispute)
- Needs help understanding the other party's perspective
- Wants to develop their BATNA (Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement)
- Is dealing with a difficult conversation or conflict
- Needs market research to support their negotiation position
- Wants to analyze a past negotiation to learn from it

## Preparation Workflow

When helping someone prepare for a negotiation, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Gather Context
Ask the user:
1. What are you negotiating? (salary, contract, purchase, dispute resolution)
2. Who is the other party?
3. What's your deadline or timeline?
4. What outcome would make you happy? What's your minimum acceptable outcome?

### Step 2: Research Phase (Use WebSearch)
Use web search to gather:
- **Market data**: Industry salary ranges, comparable prices, standard terms
- **Company information**: The other party's situation, recent news, public financials
- **Industry standards**: Typical terms, benchmarks, common practices
- **Leverage points**: Market conditions, supply/demand, timing factors

Present findings as: "Based on my research, here's what strengthens your position..."

### Step 3: Apply Wheeler's 7 Questions Framework
Work through each question with the user (full framework in references/seven-questions.md):

1. **BATNAs**: What happens if no deal? What are THEIR alternatives?
2. **Parties**: Who must agree? Who influences the decision?
3. **Interests**: What do you really want? What do THEY really want?
4. **Value**: Can you create value before claiming it?
5. **Barriers**: What obstacles might prevent agreement?
6. **Power**: What leverage do you have? What leverage do they have?
7. **Ethics**: What are your ethical boundaries?

### Step 4: Develop Strategy
Based on the analysis:
1. Define your **target outcome** (ambitious but realistic)
2. Define your **reservation point** (walk-away point)
3. Estimate their reservation point
4. Identify the **ZOPA** (Zone of Possible Agreement)
5. Prepare your **opening position**
6. Develop **3-5 creative options** that address both parties' interests

### Step 5: Anticipate and Practice
Help the user:
- Anticipate objections and prepare responses
- Practice key talking points
- Identify potential trades and concessions
- Prepare questions to ask the other party

## Making Negotiation Proposals

When the user needs help crafting a specific proposal:

1. **Research first**: Use WebSearch to gather supporting data
2. **Frame with interests**: "I propose X because it addresses your interest in Y while meeting my need for Z"
3. **Provide justification**: Use objective criteria (market rates, precedent, industry standards)
4. **Include options**: Offer 2-3 variations to give the other party choice
5. **Consider packaging**: Bundle terms to create value

### Proposal Template
```
Opening: "Based on [research/data], I'd like to propose..."

Core proposal: [Specific terms with numbers]

Justification: "This aligns with [market data/industry standards/mutual interests]"

Flexibility: "I'm open to discussing [alternative arrangements] if that works better for your situation"

Next step: "Could we [specific action] by [timeline]?"
```

## Handling Difficult Conversations

When emotions are high or the relationship is strained, use the Three Conversations Model (full framework in references/three-conversations.md):

1. **The "What Happened" Conversation**
   - Move from certainty to curiosity
   - Explore their story, don't just tell yours
   - Acknowledge contribution (not blame)

2. **The Feelings Conversation**
   - Acknowledge emotions (yours and theirs)
   - Don't let feelings be roadblocks

3. **The Identity Conversation**
   - What's at stake for your self-image?
   - What's at stake for theirs?

## Quick Reference: Perception/Emotion/Communication Checklist

Before any negotiation interaction, check:

**Perception**
- [ ] Have I considered their perspective genuinely?
- [ ] Am I making assumptions I haven't verified?
- [ ] What might they know that I don't?

**Emotion**
- [ ] Am I emotionally prepared for this conversation?
- [ ] Have I identified what might trigger me?
- [ ] Am I ready to acknowledge their emotions?

**Communication**
- [ ] Am I prepared to listen more than talk?
- [ ] Do I have clarifying questions ready?
- [ ] Can I separate the person from the problem?

## Using Search to Inform Negotiations

When preparing proposals or analyzing positions, proactively use WebSearch to find:

| Negotiation Type | Search For |
|-----------------|------------|
| Salary | Industry salary ranges, company pay scales, cost of living data |
| Real Estate | Comparable sales, market trends, days on market |
| Contract | Standard terms, typical rates, industry benchmarks |
| Vendor | Alternative suppliers, market pricing, volume discounts |
| Dispute | Legal precedents, mediation outcomes, settlement ranges |

Always cite your sources when presenting research to the user so they can reference it in their negotiation.
